# Strategy Development

Harvest Finance team works hard every day to utilize the latest and most profitable techniques to bring returns to our users. New projects are relentlessly evaluated and pursued to increase our growing repertoire of yield farming strategies.

Every new project is evaluated through stages:

* Analyze project reputation
* Review Tokenomics - TVL, rewards, distribution, fees, deflation
* Audit smart contracts for safety
* Create a strategy for collecting and auto-compounding rewards
* Release and activate strategy - grant weekly FARM rewards

**Harvest takes care of gas costs, APY tracking, strategy development, and auditing.**  
We don't have deposit/withdrawal fees for any of our strategies.  
A performance fee \(30% ETH, 8% BSC\) is on profits generated.
