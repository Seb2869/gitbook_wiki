# FARM token

In order to provide incentives to yield farmers using the Harvest platform, the `$FARM` token was released when Harvest Finance launched on September 1st, 2020. The token was bootstrap launched without any premining, venture capitalist, or investor funds, with 0 circulating supply at launch.

A key innovation of the `$FARM` token is that it entitles holders to a performance fee \(**currently 30% ETH and 8% BSC**\) taken from Harvest's yield farming strategies. While each strategy may farm different assets, the performance fee is used to buy `$FARM` on the open market, which is then distributed to those who stake `$FARM` in the Profit Sharing pool. The price of `$FARM` is subject to consistent buy pressure as a result. Moreover, when staking, your FARM token is automatically compounded upon every interaction with the Profit Sharing pool. _Directly speaking, the value of $FARM comes from the profits generated in the various deployed strategies_.

### Weekly mint

Newly minted tokens are released weekly and distributed as follows:

* 70% of the FARM tokens will be distributed to capital and liquidity providers. Details are released weekly on the [Medium](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/) blog or [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/harvest_finance).
* 10% of the FARM tokens will vest to the [Operational Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x843002b1d545ef7abb71c716e6179570582faa40) to pay for additional development and promotion.
* 20% of the FARM tokens will vest to the [Development Team](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49d71131396f23f0bce31de80526d7c025981c4d), and are occasionally sold through tornadocash for Dev pay.

### Supply

`$FARM` was launched with a hard-coded maximum supply of 5,000,000 tokens which would be minted over the course of 4 years.

In this initial period, it was noted that emissions were higher than needed for the growth of the project. As a result, a total of 14,850.108 `$FARM` tokens were burned irretrievably to [0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0246c9032bc3a600820415ae600c6388619a14d?a=0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff) to decrease the total circulating supply.

In Week 5, FARM holders [voted overwhelmingly](https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmQvoNCNhz5dARMgR82vFPeHAMPqMahHgsHjPYggFuAkGZ) to cap the maximum supply to **690,420** tokens by reducing the emissions of tokens by 4.45% every week until week 208 \(27 August 2024\) which is exactly 4 years from launch. As a result, token emissions are currently set to follow this curve:

### Governance <a id="governance"></a>

The FARM token is also used to determine voting power in Harvest governance proposals. The snapshot governance page can be found here: [https://snapshot.page/\#/farm](https://snapshot.page/#/farm).

Unlike many DAO organizations, the day-to-day running of Harvest is handled by Harvest Devs. The FARM token does _not_ give holders a vote on incentive distribution, strategy deployment/updates, addition/removal of vaults, etc. Instead, it is used for higher order strategic decisions, such as the proposal to [restructure the emissions schedule](https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmQvoNCNhz5dARMgR82vFPeHAMPqMahHgsHjPYggFuAkGZ), and the decision to [issue GRAIN as reparations](https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmYF62qGaqyHAXt88Hmxise6CFaSWxnTmi5VedZ3VX8Zy2) after the October 2020 exploit.
