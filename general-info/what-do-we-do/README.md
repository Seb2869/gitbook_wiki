# What We Do

### Harvest Finance is a Yield Aggregator that aggregates and automates the process of yield farming for our users. 

As Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) has grown, it has become increasingly common practice for protocols to provide token rewards in return for utilizing their platform, generally in the form of 'staking' tokens. Collecting these rewards is generally referred to as 'yield farming' or  'liquidity mining.' Harvest Finance acts as in intermediary in this process, collecting tokens from many users and staking them en masse on behalf of our users, saving them network fees \(gas\) and improving annual returns through auto compounding mechanisms.

On a regular basis, Harvest Finance automatically collects or 'harvests' the reward tokens on behalf of our users and exchanges them for more of the underlying assets that users deposited, thereby compounding the interest they earn. This saves our users both time and the network fees associated with making multiple transactions. 

Harvest Finance was release to bring the spirit of 69  & 420 for the people. Reciprocity and Calmness can be obtained by pooling assets then sitting back and relaxing while Harvest does the hard work of compounding interest for you.
