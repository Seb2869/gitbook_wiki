# Council of 69

Launched in the 5th week of Harvest's operation, the Council of 69 is an investment syndicate that participates in early-stage project investments. It enables savvy users to leverage the investing power of the collective to bring further rewards to our platform. 

#### How it works:

* Talented users suggest strategic investments in the \#Council-of-69 channel on Discord.
* After discussing the opportunity, a Snapshot governance proposal is created.
* Snapshot proposals that gather 1000 affirmative FARM votes move the deal forward.
* A syndicate of Harvest's developers and established investors perform due diligence to evaluate the proposal on technical and market viability.
* If approved, the proposing user helps to close the deal.
* The Harvest treasury funds the investment.
* On a liquidity event, 10% of the gains are rewarded to the user who brought in and closed the deal.
* 90% of gains are distributed to humble farmers in the profit sharing pool.
